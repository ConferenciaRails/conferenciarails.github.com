h2. more details to come

We know you want to know more about the talks and the speakers, so we are already working in the information pages for every talk/workshop. We will be updating the schedule above with links to the corresponding pages within the next few days.

Also, if you are wondering how to get to Thursday's  supper/party don't worry. We have arranged for some buses to take us there directly from the conference venue.
