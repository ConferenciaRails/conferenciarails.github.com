h2. Early Bird Registration is already over! But you can still get your regular tickets.

Just in case you are yet unsure about coming, (instead of wealthy and lazy) here you have some of the top notch speakers that will be with us.

* Last year's Ruby Hero, _Xavier Noria_ ("@fxn(Xavi Noria at twitter)":http://twitter.com/fxn) will guide us trough *Documentation from the trenches*.
* The author of Steak, _Luismi Cavallé_ ("@cavalle(Luismi Cavallé at twitter)":http://twitter.com/cavalle") will tell you to *Make your models lose weight with the CQRS Diet*
* _Esti Álvarez_ ("@esti(Esti Álvarez on twitter)":http://twitter.com/esti) will make sure you *Meet CouchDB*

There are many more of them, and we will let you now about them soon.

Keep tuned!
