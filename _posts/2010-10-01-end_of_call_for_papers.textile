h2. The call for papers period has now ended. However if you're _really_ quick there might be just enough time for your talk, but we must have all of them in by Sunday evening!

*IMPORTANT:* If you haven't received a reply from us, please send your proposal again. We know of a couple of cases were the email has not got through on the first attempt. Try sending to <a href="mailto:info@aprodeweb.es">info@aprodeweb.es</a>, the association's account if in doubt. 

This years proposals are really excellent, thank you so much to everyone who has sent us their talk or workshop. Now we have the hard task of deciding which of the talks we can fit into the time available. Assuming all goes to plan we hope to let everyone know around the middle of next week.
