Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is an architectural pattern that promises to improve the maintainability, performance and scalability of your applications by helping to separate concerns in your system.

This pattern, along with Event Sourcing and other Domain-Driven Design ideas, is gaining increased popularity, particularly among developers building solutions for rich / complex domains.
