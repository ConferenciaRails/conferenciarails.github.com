      I have been coding since the days of C64 and then slowly migrating up the stack of abstraction to those high level languages we have all come to love. Recently I find myself migrating down the stack again towards the machine when I got fascinated by evented programming using node.js and ruby.

      I'm currently team lead for Xing's Spanish office based in Barcelona and when I'm not doing managerial stuff I'm digging into ideas around optimizing our application platform. I have also published "a mongodb driver for node.js":http://github.com/christkv/node-mongodb-native and I'm currently trying my hand at writing a distributed file system in google go. Before this I got a ton of years behind me doing ruby, java, erlang etc.

The idea is to give an introduction to evented development using node.js and then focus on how to accomplish this using ruby.

The outline would look like this

* Contrast and Compare evented development against thread based development
* Introduce node.js and why it's causing a stir
* Introduce eventmachine
* Talk about a practical stack to deploy a rails app and how the parts hook together
* Round out the presentation with Pro's and Con's
