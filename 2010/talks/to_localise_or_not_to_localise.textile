We live in a globalised world where companies have to sell their products and services in the international market to make the most of their investments of time, money and resources. Especially with the current economic situation, companies of all industries are forced to become internationalized. Internet gives sotfware and web developers great opportunities and advantages. The process of translating a software or web application for different target countries or markets needs to be done with the help of specialists. The reason for that is that if the development team does not have experience or knowledge in subjects like globalisation (g11n), internationalisation (i18n) and localisation (l10n), the lack of a standarised solution could lead a project to its failure in terms of quality of the localised versions, poor sales or negative branding effects.

In this session we will talk of the need to develop applications for the international market from day 0, with statistics showing that even big corporations make more sales in foreign countries. Do you want to be out of the game?

In the second part we will explain the main methods and tools used nowadays to prepare ruby source code for translation and localisation.

We will end our presentation with the recommended best practices of localisation engineers, translators and testers for making the localisation process more easy, efficient, fast and cheap for everyone.
