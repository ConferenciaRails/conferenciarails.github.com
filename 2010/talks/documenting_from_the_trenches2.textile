This is a talk about documentation, why is it important, why is it hard, we'll discuss some myths and reflect about this topic.

Ruby is a very dynamic language, this complicates things quite a bit, we'll see specific issues depicted with examples from the Rails API.

We'll also explain what is docrails, what's going on in this aspect of the Rails project, ideas for the future, and how people can contribute to the Rails documentation.
