from neo4j website:
''Neo4j is a graph database. It is an embedded, disk-based, fully transactional Java persistence engine that stores data structured in graphs rather than in tables. A graph (mathematical lingo for a network) is a flexible data structure that allows a more agile and rapid style of development.''

Neo4j allows you to map objects to nodes and relations, that is a more natural fit than mapping them to relational tables.
Modeling with elements of a graph is substantially faster for semi­structured data (Recall that semi­structured data is data that has few mandatory but many optional attributes).

Neo4j is a powerful graph database/engine that every rails developer should know.

In this talk we will cover:

* An overview of the technology of graph databases (particularly neo4j database)
* How to model your world with nodes, relationships and properties.
* How to use neo4j with jruby, neo4j-rails for ruby on rails and neo4j-rest JSON REST API/
* Implement simple functionality for your social network site: members degrees of separation, connection path between two members, members you should know.
