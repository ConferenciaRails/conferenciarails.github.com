WebSockets are one of the most exciting innovations provided by HTML5. While
the "WebSocket API":http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/ is still a W3C's working draft, Chrome, Safari and
Firefox beta 4 already implement it.

Bi-directional, full-duplex communication channels over TCP for web clients and
web servers will definitely change the way we think about new possibilities for
web applications, at the same time they bring a much better resource
utilization.

During this talk we'll describe clients and servers, by creating a basic -
but working! - example, and review some of the existing implementations for
both Ruby and "NodeJS":http://nodejs.org/, like "Sunshowers":http://rainbows.rubyforge.org/sunshowers/
and "Socket.IO":http://socket.io/.

We'll also keep an eye into alternative implementations to Web Sockets, like
"Faye":http://faye.jcoglan.com/, which uses the "Bayeux":http://svn.cometd.com/trunk/bayeux/bayeux.html
protocol and it's also available for Ruby and NodeJS.
