               Since 1995 I've been earning my salt in software development, doing this and that in different places, industries and companies, including a small java-centric shop I co-founded —and then cowardly left— some years ago.

               Along these years I've delivered training on things like Robotics, Software Engineering, JAVA, PHP and Ruby on Rails. I have also participated in several workshops and     conferences talking about Ruby on Rails, plug-in and games programming, XML processing, CSS frameworks, SEO or agile development.

               Apart from the occasional freelancing or training gig, I'm the CTO of ASPgems, where I've been working since 2006 developing web projects with Ruby on Rails.

               I'm also the author of the book “Aptana RadRails: An IDE for Rails Development” and an active member of the local Ruby scene, being a founding member of the Spanish Rails Conference, the Spanish Ruby Users Group (SRUG) and madrid-rb, the Ruby users group in Madrid. Lately I can be seen also on the Agile Madrid group activities.

We rails people tend to think of Rails as the center-piece of web development. The same thing can be said of .net, Spring/Java Server Faces, Drupal, Python or name-your-web-framework-of-choice-here people.

Web frameworks are just a component of web applications, and if you want to succeed you better know the miriads of other components beyond your rockstar code.

In my session I will talk about things you must take into account and tools/techniques you should master if you want to make a difference in web development.
