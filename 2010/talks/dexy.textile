Dexy is a new approach to documenting your software. Dexy is a build tool
for documents, inspired by Knuth's concept of literate programming, but
with a fresh implementation and a very powerful set of features to let you
write documentation in any language and for any tool. With Dexy, the
example code and the example output in your documentation all come from
running live code, so you can write documentation quickly, maintain it
easily, and your documentation becomes another way of testing your
software.

In this talk I will introduce Dexy and discuss how it can be used for
documenting Rails project, from documenting the source code to automating
screenshots of the finished product. While Dexy happens to be written in
Python, it is usable for any language including Ruby, with the advantage
that you can use Dexy to document your polyglot projects. Your JavaScript,
Java or C code does not need to be a second-class citizen in your project
documentation.

Dexy will help you improve the quality of your code, make it painless and
fun to write awesome documentation, and help you promote (or sell!) your
project by writing helpful tutorials and user guides.
