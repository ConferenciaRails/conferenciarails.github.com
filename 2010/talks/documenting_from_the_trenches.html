<h1>«Documenting from the trenches»</h1>
<h2 class="brief">
This is a talk about documentation, why is it important, why is it hard, we'll 
discuss some myths and reflect about this topic. <br/>
<br/>
Ruby is a very dynamic language, this complicates things quite a bit, we'll see 
specific issues depicted with examples from the Rails API. <br/>
<br/>
We'll also explain what is docrails, what's going on in this aspect of the Rails 
project, ideas for the future, and how people can contribute to the Rails 
documentation.
